# HydraCache 0.75 Extended IMap foundation evidence

This directory is provisional, test-only foundation work. It does not enable a production
distributed IMap capability, allocate wire or durable identities, or close W0 before 0.74 is
published.

Run the bounded authority model and validate its exact-source receipt:

```powershell
cargo xtask imap-value-plane-model --release 0.75 --seed 117 --output target/imap-075/model-receipt.json
cargo xtask imap-foundation-evidence-check --release 0.75 --receipt target/imap-075/model-receipt.json
```

Execute all locally available foundation probes, write the thirteen canonical receipts into a new
directory, and validate the set as one exact-source unit:

```powershell
cargo xtask imap-foundation-evidence-generate --release 0.75 --seed 117 --output target/imap-075/foundation
cargo xtask imap-foundation-evidence-check --release 0.75 --receipts target/imap-075/foundation
```

The generator runs the bounded authority explorer, deterministic response-loss/replay probe,
128-step seeded stateful chaos campaign, linearizability oracle, acknowledged-owner-loss/RPO probe,
and replayable transfer/listener/bulk/lifecycle/ACK/security/surface/explorer/Java proofs. The
testkit also sweeps deterministic
three-node schedules for proxy routing, replication
proof, promotion, partition-scoped repair/rebalance, epoch catch-up, partial bulk and listener
overflow, plus executable guards for every threat in `security-contract.json`.

The provisional API also includes a test-only bounded collection/lifecycle tranche: `size`,
`is_empty`, resumable `contains_value_bounded`, `clear_detailed`, `destroy`, `evict`,
`evict_all_detailed`, and paged `key_set`, `values`, and `entry_set` views. Pages carry a snapshot
revision and reject stale cursors; bounded searches return `partial` instead of inventing absence;
collection-wide mutations preflight their item budget before changing visible state. These names
and semantics allocate no production wire or durable identity.

Run all locally available Rust distributed-foundation proofs and optionally retain their evidence
with one command:

```powershell
cargo xtask imap-distributed-correctness --release 0.75 --evidence target/imap-075/local-proof
```

Validate the operation/security contracts and the pinned Hazelcast source provenance:

```powershell
cargo xtask imap-contract-check --release 0.75
cargo xtask imap-hazelcast-source-check --release 0.75
```

Passing these gates means only that the foundation is internally consistent. Production routing,
backend activation, final protocol identities, performance claims, and release admission remain
blocked by the dependencies recorded in `status.json`.

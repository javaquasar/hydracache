# HydraCache 0.75 Extended IMap foundation evidence

This directory is provisional, test-only foundation work. It does not enable a production
distributed IMap capability, allocate wire or durable identities, or close W0 before 0.74 is
published.

Run the bounded authority model and validate its exact-source receipt:

```powershell
cargo xtask imap-value-plane-model --release 0.75 --seed 117 --output target/imap-075/model-receipt.json
cargo xtask imap-foundation-evidence-check --release 0.75 --receipt target/imap-075/model-receipt.json
```

Validate the operation/security contracts and the pinned Hazelcast source provenance:

```powershell
cargo xtask imap-contract-check --release 0.75
cargo xtask imap-hazelcast-source-check --release 0.75
```

Passing these gates means only that the foundation is internally consistent. Production routing,
backend activation, final protocol identities, performance claims, and release admission remain
blocked by the dependencies recorded in `status.json`.

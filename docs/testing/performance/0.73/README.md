# HydraCache 0.73 local performance screening

`local-screening-073-v1` is the first W0 contract. It makes local development evidence reusable
without allowing a laptop, workstation, WSL, or shared runner to create a release performance
claim.

Validate the checked-in contract and example:

```text
cargo xtask performance-contract-check --release 0.73
```

Capture a privacy-safe local context before screening a candidate:

```text
cargo xtask performance-local-context --release 0.73
```

The generated `target/performance-evidence/0.73/local/context.json` binds the exact source SHA,
dirty-tree state, OS/architecture, logical CPU count, and hashed CPU/toolchain identities. Raw CPU
model text, hostname, username, home path, serial numbers, and network addresses are not retained.
The fingerprint covers only stable identity: timestamps and source state do not silently turn the
same host into a different machine.

`baseline-identities.toml` distinguishes the annotated/peeled published `B72`, the post-publish
branch root `R73`, and the still-unfrozen `I73`. `post-tag-delta.toml` classifies every path between
`v0.72.0` and `R73`; the checker recomputes that Git diff and rejects missing, stale, or status-mismatched
entries. The current ledger has no product-runtime or production-instrumentation path, so none of the
post-tag changes is silently treated as an optimization baseline.

`scenario-matrix.toml` preregisters the complete W2-W9 surface and wave coverage, concurrency/load
lanes, mixed-runtime weights and evidence invariants. It intentionally remains in `pilot` state with
stable rates and measurement windows marked `unmeasured`; candidate measurement is forbidden until
baseline-only calibration and production-instrumentation overhead evidence freeze `I73`.

Validate a generated receipt:

```text
cargo xtask performance-contract-check --release 0.73 --receipt target/performance-evidence/0.73/local/<attempt>/receipt.json
```

Generate that receipt with `cargo xtask performance-local-receipt`. The command takes the context,
prebuilt binary, frozen scenario, raw-series and outcome JSON paths plus the pair metadata shown by
`cargo xtask --help`; it hashes all file inputs and refuses schema or accounting violations before
writing the receipt. This keeps manual hashes and copied host/source identities out of the workflow.
`local-screening-outcomes.example.json` provides the required accounting shape for runner adapters;
real attempts replace its counts and retain every non-success outcome.

Every receipt binds the exact source, prebuilt binary, scenario, host fingerprint, raw series,
instrumentation mode, pair order, and complete operation outcomes. Failed and invalidated attempts
remain append-only. Local receipts always carry `promotable: false` and
`numerical_claim_eligible: false`; `--require-ship` therefore fails until later W0/W10 contracts
add dedicated-host and integrated-candidate evidence.

# Join the remaining production D-Bus helpers

Continuation of the approved security backport/caller migration, without a new
performance hypothesis. The preceding full Message graph used zbus 6 for fifteen
original callers but left diagnostic_manager.rs, diagnostic_loaded.rs and
systemd_unit.rs on zbus 5. Passing isolated helper probes did not join these
production callers or remove the old production edge.

The new exclusive source copy pins each complete original file and reuses the
qualified bridge_v2.rs. It changes import/API spelling and selects the preserved
multi-threaded blocking bridge; it retains all old caller functions/tests,
manager read/error/sender order, cache selection, connection method timeout,
Operation origins, all original frame/kernel predicates and 300/60/10 windows.
No unreviewed per-call runtime, dummy effect, lint exemption or hidden exclusion.

The old zbus production requirement moves to an explicit Linux dev-dependency
because the existing ignored manual negotiated transport/credential adapter still
requires it. All complete lock bytes stay exact. This intermediate step must not
be called complete security remediation: the old branch remains in the test/lock
graph. Porting that real backend, source/distribution review and eventual root
adoption remain independent gates. The root product dependency/source graph is
not changed by this temporary integration candidate.

The first inert preparation is retained. Source review found the inherited outer
owner's writer binding was absent before dispatch; a distinct owner-bound context
adds that original binding and keeps the same existing CI owner. No command was
executed against the earlier preparation. New fixed contexts are
target/dbus-legacy-integration-20261028/owner-bound and the native 20261028-a2.

Three inert controls require all original tests and operation/timeout markers,
whole-body drift refusal, the qualified v2 wrapper and multi-threaded feature.
The actual next command is library check and strict all-feature Clippy on GNU
Rust 1.94/1.88 under the exact original Windows Job/Linux pidfd-subreeper envelope:
1200/1100-second origins, 4 GiB floors, five-second polling/retirement. Preserve
the first result of every command and never extend deadlines or retry unchanged
input. Compilation does not execute a manager, bus, service, clock, server or
product workload. Full unit execution and dependency-policy adoption follow
separately after actual source compatibility, not from this plan alone.

The first actual owner-bound GNU 1.94 check refuses two wire import spellings:
single OwnedValue and grouped Value are now OwnedVariant/Variant. Original
source/boot postflight and both CI retirement layers pass; no tests ran and
MSRV/Clippy remain unstarted for that source. A distinct api-bound/native-a3
context changes exactly those two import aliases, keeps every function/test and
complete lock, and adds refusal controls. It does not repeat the consumed source
or relabel its failed check.

The api-bound check then succeeds, but strict Clippy refuses three unused private
bridge API groups: from_async/close, the retained connection field and its getter.
No lint is waived. The separate used-api/native-a4 candidate removes only those
three unused methods and names the still-retained ownership field _connection;
the original clone, field order and in-runtime async-proxy Drop remain. Four
inert controls now include that lifetime/drop preservation. Check/Clippy/MSRV
must produce actual distinct verdicts; the two earlier refusals remain intact.

The first used-api check refuses E0560: the direct Proxy constructor still used
the old field spelling while ProxyBuilder used _connection. The original clone/
drop remained but that candidate does not compile. Preserve the failed input.
A separate used-api-fixed/native-a5 context corrects only that initializer and
strengthens the lifetime control to require both constructor spellings. No old
source or receipt is overwritten and no unchanged command is repeated.

The longer used-api-fixed Windows path refuses during inert copy of two retained
raw evidence members (WinError 3); no freeze or native command is created for it.
Its partial directory is kept. The same constructor repair is prepared in a
shorter exclusive fixed/native-a6 context, without system long-path settings,
source deletion or changes to any test/runtime bound.

The final fixed source completes library check and strict all-feature Clippy on
GNU Rust 1.94 and MSRV 1.88, with actual source/boot and CI-retirement postflight.
No test execution is credited by those four passes. The next separately pinned
unit driver builds actual full default images in that same native source context,
requires both 1,593-case catalogs, executes exactly 64 source-bound original cases
and runs strict test-cfg/all-feature Clippy. It preserves original predicates,
timeouts and envelope and never selects ignored real-bus/privileged cases. Three
offline catalog/accounting controls pass. A real verdict remains required; this
still cannot remove old zbus 5 from its explicitly retained dev/test graph.

That first full test-image build finds two E0659 import ambiguities in manager/
loaded tests: the super glob exposes the local zbus 6 alias beside the retained
external zbus 5 test crate. No test executes. Preserve that first cfg-test result,
retirement and source/boot postflight. A new tests/native-a7 candidate qualifies
exactly those two function-local imports as zbus6; production bodies stay equal
to fixed. Recheck the changed source and then the same complete 64-case gate.
Old a2/a3/a4 build caches (about 1.0 GB logical) are removed after owned retirement
and no observed consumer; all source/log/receipt trees and current a6 images stay.
Windows physical free space is unchanged by this WSL cache deletion; no VHD
compaction, system settings, service or clock change is performed.
